The goal of this analysis was to use Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions in our Crypto dataset. We transformed our dataset, scaled it, used an Elbow curve to determine our number of Kmeans clusters, fit and modeled the data, added our model.labels_ to our dataset, and visualized the results.
